A bullet of mass m = 0.010 kg is fired horizontally and embeds itself in a stationary wooden block of mass M = 0.990 kg suspended by a light string of length L = 0.80 m. After the collision, the bullet-block system swings upward and rises to a maximum height h = 0.20 m above its initial position. Assume g = 10 $m/s^2$ throughout this problem. The bullet enters the block from the left and the two objects move together immediately after impact. You may treat the block as a point mass located at the end of the string.\n\nAdditional scenario for part (e): A second experiment is conducted on a frictionless horizontal surface. Two carts are placed at rest. Cart A (mass 2m) is positioned at x = 0 m, and Cart B (mass 3m) is positioned at x = 0.60 m.
