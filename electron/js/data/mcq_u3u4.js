      "Making all variables public",
      "Copying code from existing classes"

    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and only exposing the necessary interface. Users of a class don't need to know how methods work internally."

    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Encapsulation is the practice of keeping fields private and providing public methods to access/modify them. This protects data integrity and hides implementation."

    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Java passes object references by value. The method gets a copy of the reference, which points to the same object. Changes to the object's fields through the reference affect the original object."

      "Java prohibits static methods from doing anything"

    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Static methods execute in a class context, not an instance context. There is no 'this' reference in a static method, so they cannot refer to instance fields that belong to a specific object."

Result: 3 2 1 1 2 3. Wait that's option 3. Let me recheck: print(3), recurse→print(2), recurse→print(1), recurse→return. Now unwind: print(1), return to 2: print(2), return to 3: print(3).
