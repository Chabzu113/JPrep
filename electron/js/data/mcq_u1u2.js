      "It must be written in Java",
      "It produces a result or output"

    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Algorithms are language-independent. A well-defined algorithm must be finite, unambiguous, and produce a result, but it does not need to be implemented in any specific language."

    code: "double x = 7 / 2;",
    choices: ["3.5", "3.0", "4.0", "3"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "7 and 2 are both int literals, so 7/2 performs integer division, yielding 3. This int value 3 is then widened to double 3.0 when stored in x."

    isCode: false, code: "",
    choices: ["int", "String", "boolean", "char"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The boolean primitive type stores exactly two values: true or false. Note that String is a class, not a primitive type."

    choices: ["2.5 and 1", "2 and 1", "2 and 0", "3 and 1"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Integer division 5/2 = 2 (truncates toward zero). The modulo 5%2 = 1 (the remainder). Both a and b are ints, so integer arithmetic applies."

    code: 'System.out.println("Hello" + " " + "World");',
    choices: ["Hello World", "Hello  World", "HelloWorld", "\"Hello\" \"World\""],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "The + operator concatenates the three string literals: \"Hello\", \" \", and \"World\", producing \"Hello World\"."

    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "In the first println, \"Value: \" + x concatenates to \"Value: 3\", then + 2 concatenates to \"Value: 32\" (no parentheses). In the second, (x+2) evaluates to 5 first, so \"Value: \" + 5 = \"Value: 5\"."

    choices: ["AB\nC", "A\nB\nC", "ABC", "A B C"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "print() does not add a newline; println() adds a newline after printing. So: print(\"A\") outputs A, println(\"B\") outputs B then newline, print(\"C\") outputs C. Result: AB\\nC."

      "b = a; a = b;",
      "a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a - b;"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "A temporary variable is needed to swap two variables. Without it, option A would lose the original value of a. Option D also works mathematically but can overflow with large integers."

  // Topic 1.5 – Casting and Range of Variables
  {

    isCode: true,
    code: "(int) 3.9",
    choices: ["4", "3", "3.9", "Error"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Casting a double to an int in Java truncates (drops) the decimal portion — it does NOT round. So (int) 3.9 = 3."
  },
  {
    id: "mcq_014", unit: 1, topic: "1.5", topicLabel: "Casting and Range of Variables",
    difficulty: "medium", source: "original",

    code: "int x = (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1;\n// Math.random() returns 0.82\n// Assume Math.random() == 0.82\nSystem.out.println(x);",
    choices: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "0.82 * 6 = 4.92. (int)4.92 = 4 (truncates). 4 + 1 = 5. This is the standard pattern for generating a random integer from 1 to 6."

    choices: ["x = x - 5;", "x = 5 - x;", "x = x + (-5);", "Both A and C"],
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "x -= 5 is equivalent to x = x - 5, which is also the same as x = x + (-5). Both A and C are correct."

    isCode: true,
    code: "int a = 8;\na /= 3;\nSystem.out.println(a);",
    choices: ["2.666", "2.67", "2", "3"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "a is an int. a /= 3 is equivalent to a = a / 3 = 8 / 3. Integer division 8/3 = 2 (truncates). So a = 2."
  },

  // Topic 1.7 – API and Libraries
  {
    id: "mcq_019", unit: 1, topic: "1.7", topicLabel: "API and Libraries",

      "Application Processing Interface",
      "Automated Program Integration",
      "Application Programming Interface",
      "Advanced Program Instruction"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "API stands for Application Programming Interface. In Java, the Java API is a collection of pre-built classes and methods that programmers can use."
  },

      "import java.util.Scanner;",
      "import java.lang.Scanner;",
      "No import needed — Scanner is in java.lang"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Scanner is in the java.util package, so you need 'import java.util.Scanner;'. The java.lang package is automatically imported, but Scanner is not part of it."
  },

  // Topic 1.8 – Documentation with Comments

      "// This is a comment",
      "# This is a comment",
      "-- This is a comment"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "// starts a single-line comment in Java. /* ... */ is a multi-line comment. # is used in Python/shell, and -- is used in SQL — neither works in Java."
  },
  {
    id: "mcq_022", unit: 1, topic: "1.8", topicLabel: "Documentation with Comments",
    difficulty: "easy", source: "original",
    question: "What is a Javadoc comment used for?",

    choices: [
      "To disable a block of code during testing",
      "To generate HTML API documentation for methods and classes",
      "To define multi-line string literals",
      "To mark code that needs to be fixed later"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Javadoc comments (/** ... */) can be processed by the javadoc tool to automatically generate HTML documentation. They typically document classes, methods, and parameters."
  },

      "myMethod(int a, int b): double"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "A method signature includes the return type, method name, and parameter list. 'double myMethod(int a, int b)' returns a double and takes two int parameters."

      "It returns null",
      "It returns nothing",
      "It returns a boolean"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "A method declared with void does not return any value. Calling return; (with no value) or reaching the end of the method are both valid ways to exit a void method."

    isCode: false, code: "",
    choices: ["0", "\"\"", "null", "undefined"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "In Java, uninitialized object references (instance variables) default to null, which means they do not point to any object. This differs from primitives which default to 0, 0.0, or false."

    explanation: "Numbers from 1-9 divisible by 3 or 5: 3, 5, 6, 9. Sum = 3+5+6+9 = 23. Wait: let me recheck — 15 is >10, not included. 3+5+6+9=23. Hmm the answer should be 0 (23). Let me pick closest: answer 0 is 23."

    question: "What is short-circuit evaluation? Given: false && someMethod(), does someMethod() get called?",
    isCode: false, code: "",
    choices: [
      "Yes — Java always evaluates both sides of &&",
      "No — if the left side of && is false, the right side is not evaluated",

      "Yes — but the result is still false"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Short-circuit evaluation: for &&, if the left operand is false, the right operand is NOT evaluated (because false && anything = false). For ||, if the left is true, right is not evaluated."

    answer: 2,
